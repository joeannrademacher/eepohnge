Tentando di rimuoverlo si ferisce profondamente. Da quel momento la sua vita diventa un incubo fatto di demoni e sogni perversi, e il suo corpo si ricopre velocemente di metallo…. Any love for it here? I've seen it countless times at this point, totally captivated and obsessed. From the aesthetics, body horror, themes of sexuality and the brutality of industrialized society, and the amazing soundtrack by Chu Ishikawa. For me it encapsulates perfectly the general feeling I get from industrial music. That sense of dread and horror, mixed with scrap, metal, run-down factories, and total monstrosity. It's industrial music in its most literal form. Honestly one of my favorite. 
Robert Fuoco argues for a McLuhanesque reading of Tsukamoto's Tetsuo in which the merging of pain with pleasure, man and metal unite new media with old through an intense fusion of several different avant-garde and experimental art styles and tendencies. Holy god. 10/10, tied with Invasion of the Body Snatchers 78 for my number 1 all time slot. This movie is metal sex cyberpunk mayhem. And to think I thought Eraserhead was the strangest movie I've ever seen. Absolute classic.

Horror these days seem to be focusing on slow long takes that build tension. Which I love but I want a change of pace. The only American film I think compares to the style is Crank, which is amazing, but not a horror.
